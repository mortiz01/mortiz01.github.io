			<p>My name is Michael Ortiz, and I am currently a Technologist with Booz Allen Hamilton. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and American Studies from Wesleyan University and am working towards a Graduate Certificate in Mathematics at George Washington University. </p>
			<p>I intend to pursue a Ph.D in American Studies. My research interests include Latinx aesthetic and cultural production, performance studies, memory and trauma studies, literary theory, colonial/postcolonial studies, and Latinx/Latin American history and cultural studies. Specifically, I am interested in the relationship between cultural history, artistic production, and social memory.  </p>
			<p>At Booz Allen, I reside within the Digital Solutions Account. I am currently a student at General Assembly, a coding bootcamp, developing the skills necessary to become a Web Developer. Our work has so far covered HTML and CSS, with Javascript, Ruby, and other languages to follow. I am passionate about coding as a skill and toolset, and about using my technical skills to better the lives of others.</p>
